Overview of Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis looking into weather data in Hawaii, is based on our interest in opening an ace cream shop in Hawaii. We are working with the assumption that an ice cream shop will prosper better when the weather is warmer. And there will not be as many sales when the weather is cooler. 

Results:

-In our analysis we found that the average temperature in Hawaii is about 75 degrees farenheit (74.944118) in the month of June, and 

-the average temperature is 71 degrees farenheit in December (71.041529). 

-The temperature range in July is 64-85 degrees farenheit.

-The temperature range in December is 56-83 degrees farenheit.

-The standard deviation of temperature is 3.26 in June and 3.75 in December, meaning that the variability of weather is close to equal, but only a bit more variable in December. 

Summary:

In looking at the results, the data shows that Hawaii would be a great place to open a ice cream shop. It is warm in the summer, and remains relatively warm (still above 70 degrees) in the winter. It may be good to also look into data regarding precipitation. People may not be as likely to go out for ice cream when it is rainy. Performing a query to see if there are any particularily rainy months would be useful. It also might be good to query temperature and precipitation data for other months outside of June and December. This is a good place to start as we have a sample of a summer month and a winter month, but we shouldn't make assumptions about Hawaii's weather patterns. Perhaps December is still relatively warm, but January and February are much colder, leading to less potential for ice cream sales.
